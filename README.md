## Troubleshooting Git Push Errors

If you encounter an error like `fatal: ... does not appear to be a git repository` when running `git push`, it likely means your local repository's remote URL is incorrect.

To fix this, you can update the URL using the following command in your terminal. Replace the URL with your repository's correct HTTPS or SSH address.

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

After updating the URL, you should be able to push your changes successfully.
